sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: Although it has the same Omicron as sort3 (O(n^2)), bubble sort
performs more swaps. So it gets slower times when testing random.
Has different Omega than sort3 (Ω(n)), so it gets faster times.

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: Fastest method gets fastest times.

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: Although it has the same Omicron as sort1 (O(n^2)), select sort
performs less swaps. So it gets faster times when testing random.
Has different Omega than sort3 (Ω(n^2)), so it gets slower times.
