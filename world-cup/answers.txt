Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
I am surprised that the one million N simulation was so slow.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
I suppose the 100,000 N simulation would be a happy medium.
