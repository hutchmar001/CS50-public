First get the average energy, valence, and danceability numbers of the person's top 100.
Take each category and assign it a "mood" according to whichever is the closest match.
For example, if the average energy is a 0.5, the energy for "purple" is a 0.6, the energy for "green"
is a 0.9, and the energy for "yellow" is a 0.3, then the category gets a "purple". 

In case of a tie (ex. "pink", "orange", "yellow"), then take the second-closest matches into account.
For example, if the first place winners are "pink", "orange", "yellow" and the second place winners
are "pink", "red", "blue", then the category gets a "pink", treating each color as an equal vote.
So on and so forth until there is a clear winner.
