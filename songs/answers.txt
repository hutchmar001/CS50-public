First get the average energy, valence, and danceability numbers of the person's top 100.
Take each category and assign it a color according to whichever is the closest match.
For example, if the average energy is a 0.5, the energy for "purple" is a 0.6, the energy for "green"
is a 0.9, and the energy for "yellow" is a 0.3, then the category gets a "purple".

Unfortunately there will always be a tie because we need two winning colors from only three categories.
We must take the second-closest matches into account. For example, if the first place winners
are "pink", "orange", "yellow" and the second place winners are "pink", "orange", "blue", then
this person gets a "pink" and "orange", treating each color as an equal vote.
If this fails, continue in the same way until there are two clear winners.

How to improve? Adding more categories will improve accuracy. Perhaps tempo, duration, loudness,
and speechiness could be taken into account? Also, calculating the winning color for each song, then
finding the winning color among the top 100 would improve accuracy. That may be at the expense of time,
but if the data concerning the colors of the songs were stored in a database beforehand, it would not be.
