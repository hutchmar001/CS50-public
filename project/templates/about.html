    <p style="text-align: left; width: 5%;>This website lets you compare the three major holy books from the world's three biggest religions: Christianity,
Islam, and Hinduism. These books are the Bible, the Quran, and the Bhagavad Gita. There are two major sections: You can search for
a keyword or you can search for a specific book/chapter/verse.
    Let's look at the former. If you search for the word 'dog', it will print out all the verses in these books that contain that
word. If you so wish, you can select just the results from one of the specific books. Notice that the results are paginated, with
a default of 20 results per page, or rpp. You can change that number to whichever you wish. So if you have 10,000 results and you
want to view one per page, well, nobody is going to stop you. Also, you have a highlighter, which will highlight your query
in the results. Click to highlight and click again to dehighlight. Finally, you will receive an error if your query or rpp is
blank or invalid.
    Let's look at the latter. You can get results for the Bible by inputting: a book, a book and a chapter, or a
book, chapter, and verse. You can get results for the Quran by inputting: a surah or a surah and a verse. You can get results for
the Bhagavad Gita by inputting: a chapter or a chaper and a verse. Any query that does not make sense will result in an error. For
example, if you search for surah 1 and verse 3, your query is valid. However, if you search for a bible chapter of 6 and a bible
verse of 10, your query is invalid. This section includes the pagination and highlighting functions contained above.
    I hope that this website is useful to you. Enjoy!"</p>
